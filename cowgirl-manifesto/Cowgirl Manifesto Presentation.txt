Cowgirl Manifesto Presentation:Brief: Produce a proposal for an engaging online environment project deploying net art / alternate coding toolsets and/or e-literature techniques (it could be connected to using collaborative workship/ dialog and/or experimentation in writing &/or performance) responding to this provided brief.Ass1 feedback: “attending to the bodies and materials as the site where the poetic (political and intersectional) agonism manifests…”Reflecting AFK (away from keyboard) poetry reading thru TBT.The Cowgirl Manifesto was written in 2020. It paints the dystopian image of a world enveloped by big tech and big data ranches. Heavily influenced by xenofeminism, cyberfeminism, and glitch. To reflect the style of glitch, wherein Russell asks us to “revisit, occupy, and decolonize” media (using a Walt Whitman quote), the Cowgirl Manifesto contains excerpts from Patti Smith, Tom Jones, and TS Eliot, as well as biblical references.The Cowgirl Manifesto uses the cowgirl/cowboy metaphor and these references to popular culture to convey disenfranchisement under capitalist technological infrastructure. Cowgirls are the outlawed insurgents to the data wranglers of the Big Data Ranches. They harness tools traditionally used by Cowboys to interrupt the herd. Cowgirl can be used as an adjective: “The way you released the full track list for that mix, including the deep discogs cuts, was very cowgirl”, or “skipping Uber to catch the bus is cowgirl”. Reference the poem in the design – creating a mis en scene of sorts with ephemeral media that appears and disappears as the poem is spun?What constitutes data? “Data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing” usually in binary form. According to google, “things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.”https://blog.d4bl.org/introducing-nomoredataweapons/data weapons: “any technological tool used to surveil, police and criminalize Black and Brown communities”Data is not unbiased, it is not objective.<<Inspired by the imperfect amalgamation that is exitsense.net, symbols will be distorted and repurposed thru GIF, CSS animation and image manipulation. One idea is to enable scroll on the BG while the time based text is overlayed and slightly transparent.>>“Old Western Sound Effect Ambient noise” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJnlKxWtmUI&ab_channel=suedejonesSo in the presentation it was mentioned to go deeper into the cowgirl metaphor. I like this idea. It’s a strong symbol. Above is a link to some sound inspirations. Because of the talk about the natural world in the poem, I like the idea of the western film sound as it feels like they walk the line of “the birth” of all encompassing technology, namely the railroads being built across America. Spaghetti Westerns also an This song feels relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFa1-kciCb4&ab_channel=jordanharding{<<To have a “yellow fog” gradually forming over the viewport. The user has to use their cursor to move the fog out of the way as it closes in on the tbt.>>— the fog is a reference to a TS Eliot poem where he speaks of a yellow fog licking its tongue into the corners of city folk’s nights — as I have referenced in the cowgirl manifesto.Resources for this: https://codepen.io/oscicen/pen/zyJeJw.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqzZ0SbSgHYThe uncovering of the poem thru the smoke is a slight nod to the article metaphors of decryption Musiol (2018) states: “The illegibility of the architecture of different knowledge systems has been a key preoccupation of radical critical work” akin to this the xenofeminists pose: “We want to cultivate the exercise of positive freedom–freedom-to rather than simply freedom-from–and urge feminists to equip themselves with the skills to redeploy existing technologies and invent novel cognitive and material tools in the service of common ends.” (0x07) https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/>>}After the presentation I’m questioning the choice for the yellow fog. There’s some sort of mood I’m trying to conjure, the fog is almost it… but not quite. Maybe going deeper down the cowgirl track… The reason I chose this dark almost black colour, and the soft shadow on the text is a reference to old silent western films. Now I’m imagining more cowgirl artefacts/remnants of pop culture spread thru out. I will have to do some further research I think (In other wrrds watch a lot of spaghetti westerns and cartoons).Perhaps more imagery to do with droving, team penning, general cowpeople activities etc. Herds of sheep and cows being rounded up by “wranglers”. Something I really liked about the exitsense website was the moment of pause it allowed. I’d like to have people step outside their physicality and enter some form of active engagement while they are viewing the cowgirl manifesto which is why I initially thought to incorporate the fog somehow, though this also raises the question of what role our physical bodies play in our engagement with computers... to be truly present there needs to be some awareness of the physical I suppose? This then leads to themes of slow computing, Fraser and Kitchin mention  “slow computing entails a sequence of identifying contingencies – moments in life when refusing to play a part in hyper-communication, -coordination, - consumption, -production would not negatively impact on others” (Fraser & Kitchin 2017) https://www.britishscienceassociation.org/blog/live-coding-brings-programming-to-life-an-interview-with-alex-macThere is the potential to do a live performance for the website’s debut. Then after that the tbt will be the recorded text from the performance and “archived” on the webpage.I also need to work out how to have the page scroll automatically with the text a la the star wars intro.TECH REQUIREMENTS:Minimal, I’ll use my laptop and internet connection to source artefacts, then perhaps process thru photoshop/premiere which we gain access to thru RMIT, and put it all together on VSCode.TIMELINE:We’ve got 4 weeks to build it. I’ll spend the first couple of weeks sourcing artefacts and planning their positioning/timing in the performance. The next week I imagine will be spent putting it all together in code. The final week will be allocated to finishing touches, general mulling over of ideas and the opportunity to debug/perhaps test the live performance aspect if I choose to go ahead with it.Alistair Fraser1 and Rob Kitchin. 2017.

I’m able to glean profound maturities into how you are approaching the content - that may seem like an overstatement – but your assignment has me a lot of material - to give you feedback for your consideration on the further development…. obviously you can take or leave these suggestions / and pathways - but I thought it worth being verbose at this stage. My response to your plethora of potent provocations - is by no means exhaustive but should be read as a start with the anticipation we will continue the exchange about the assignment … first to say I adore the Cowgirl Manifesto http://girlonroad.tech/cowgirl-manifesto/ and the soundtrack that accompanies it – https://soundcloud.com/mxtildx/cowgirl-manifesto-31-07/s-B3MwtJM3JRw is a compelling digital frontier ballad Your spoken word / lyrics - is very profound and very Australian and I am very moved. ((It reminds me of the energy of the electro clash stuff coming out of Berlin when I was ‘young’…and touring in bands and so on and of course Patti smith also thought of ‘Geraldine Fibbers’ do you know the sounds of Carla Ragin Bozulich - thought of her… she’s kind of country grungy..).. “There is the potential to do a live performance for the website’s debut. nice – this could also be live virtual considering the way things are at the moment … “need to work out how to have the page scroll automatically” that is an easy fix with JavaScript… The uncovering of the poem thru the smoke will be compelling- to be sure - you say “I’m questioning the choice for the yellow fog. There’s some sort of mood I’m trying to conjure, the fog is almost it… but not quite.” I’m thinking of the bushfires and the outback Also, the dust devils https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=dust%20devils I like how you reflect on the choices on the details reference to old silent western films and the film noir is also coming up for me and the ambiguous scourge and hubbub of the bandit that transmutes existing content as raw material for which to improvise and riff upon… You say the railroads being built across America what about the Australian outback and so on? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Australian_Railway “Now I’m imagining more cowgirl artefacts/remnants of pop culture spread thru out.” ****just remember simple = sacred – make sure you don’t bury the text and the cow girl*** http://matildasutherland.com/NXTNTR/c-manifesto/index.html this is overwhelming at the moment and doesn’t engage me … as an audience… Sometimes we tend to crowd things and throw a lot of things in to cover up our insecurity or confidence and I can assure you the work is good . Think carefully how all the elements come together to form a constellation … ie. see this work – the elements are there but composed with absolute precision http://www.lindadement.com/art-peasants.htm This is my reading of it thus far – that is the text Cowgirl Manifesto http://girlonroad.tech/cowgirl-manifesto/ as I listen to the soundtrack that accompanies it – https://soundcloud.com/mxtildx/cowgirl-manifesto-31-07/s-B3MwtJM3JRw An eerie incongruity arises between the stillness and remoteness of the browser site and the intense tenebrous spectacle taking place, as it were, in the middle of nowhere. Through telekinesis you channel the cowgirl… In solipsistic conversations Cowgirl muses about data, habitus and morphology as she demystifies the isomorphic realms of computer subculture … The narrative strategy of Cowgirls evokes and exposes the duplicity of implied norms and values that act in concert with both orthodox programming and Cowgirl traditions in masking the intransigence of racial-gendered-socio-cultural discriminations. The sassiness of the Cowgirl offers an antidote that is able to assist in their dismantling, unravelling the authority of the programmer, the musician, the artist the designer, in order to rewrite, scramble, interlace and intertwine; improvising and divining meaning anew. Explicit here are the inequalities that are implicit in the previous Cowgirls, in which this Cowgirl has been inscribed, I perceive the Cowgirl Manifesto as an affirmative act to rewrite these narratives… The black box stage of the networked computer imports the kinetic abstractions through augmentations of touch, the Cowgirl, with whip, perhaps affects the smoke the language and data to reform them in a way that may better speak to alterities? The distributed Cowgirl character is summoned through performative parsing of code, generating an interstitial space for the audience's imaginary – the tenuous breath of the characters voice, perhaps could be also accompanied by the rhythmic audial diddle of typing? I’m sharing a quote by one of my favourite artists and philosophers that have been triggered : ‘My own forays into this territory border on a kind of banditry, the need for which has slowly evolved out of a dilemma imposed by subject matter.’ Yvonne Rainer Unravelling what constitutes twenty first century art mediums, the argot of techne,´ philosopher Isabelle Stengers clarifies ‘is why technology of belonging is not a technique of production but…works both as challenging and fostering…must make explicit the cosmopolitical stance, that … cannot be reduced to some human production, not because it would be "supernatural", but because it would be a syntax error.’ On this lure of poetic overflow Stengers enunciates how ‘the ecology of practice…must be celebrated as a "cosmic event", a mutation which does not depend on humans only, but on humans as belonging, that is as obliged and exposed by their obligations. Such an event is not something which can be produced at will.’ I mentioned to go deeper into the cowgirl metaphor. I didn’t mean go American country and western but of course it is your project : ) [[[It could be my personal taste so this doesn’t count as I am not marking on subjective taste but I thought I’d share it I really can’t stand western film sound – it reminds me of being a little girl and long lonely weekends that never ended and a western was always on tv ]]]] There is so much attention to America and there are amazing talented people like you in Australia so let’s just centre that work being done here : ) ? On a side note – if you make a set of compelling live performances with your sound work - accompanied by the mise en scene of digital environments aka live coding - there will be a lot of audience for it – * I am sure you know you’re way around but please do keep me posted beyond this studio and I have some tips and happy to guide where necessary on this … Check your links ie., but as I knew what was happening but fyi the link was a double up: https://soundcloud.com/mxtildx/cowgirl-manifesto-31-07/s-B3MwtJM3JRwhttps://soundcloud.com/mxtildx/cowgirl-manifesto-31-07/s-B3MwtJM3JRw refs – Isabelle Stengers, “Introductory Notes on an Ecology of Practices,” Cultural studies review 11 (2005), No. 1, 183–196 (2005) p.192.
